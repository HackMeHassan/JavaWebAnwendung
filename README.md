The Java Web-2.0 Application is a Project Funding website. The role  of a user of this website can be divided into two categories. A user can either be a project starter, who would be able to create a project, set a target amount to be achieved within a particular time and put it up for the collection of donations. Or the user can act as a donor, who would be able to donate for the projects of his choice. Before using the website the user has to create an account an register himself as either a project starter or a donor. To donate for the project the donor has to fill in a form and provide all the necessary details such as name,contact info and IBAN. Each project has an expiration date and if the targeted amount set by the project starter is not achieved before the expiration date the project's status is changed to failed and the money from it's donors is returned to their accounts. Notification of events takes place over email.
